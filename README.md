# RaspiNDI

**❗ This branch is for Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm! ❗**

A core library has changed names in the latest builds of Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm that necessitates maintaining two separate branches, unless the library is backported to Bullseye. For those who have updated to Bullseye, please use the 'bullseye' branch.

RasPi-NDI-HDMI is a fork from the [raspindi](https://github.com/raspberry-pi-camera/raspindi). It includes auto start services for NDI and HDMI output, controlled by a momentary push button on GPIO pin 21. 

It uses the NDI library, allowing for auto-discovery of streams on the local network.

**❗ This software does not work with USB cameras. It uses the native libary for the on-board camera port. ❗**

## Supported boards

This software is tested with Raspberry Pi 3B+ boards. Some users have had success running it on a Rapsberry Pi 4. **The Pi Zero W does not have enough memory to run this software**

## Latency Notes
Raspberry Pi 3b+ = ~600ms   
Raspberry Pi 4b (4GB Model Tested) = ~200ms

## Getting started - compile your own

These intructions are for a clean installation of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/). All steps are performed on the command line.

### tl;dr

- `git clone https://github.com/SBCV-apegram/RasPi-NDI-HDMI.git && cd RasPi-NDI-HDMI`
- `./easy-setup.sh`
- `/opt/RasPi-NDI-HDMI/RasPi-NDI-HDMI.sh`

### Step by step

Make sure git is installed.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

```
git clone https://github.com/SBCV-apegram/RasPi-NDI-HDMI.git && cd RasPi-NDI-HDMI
```

Install compilation dependencies.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libconfig++-dev cmake libboost-program-options-dev libevent-dev libcamera-dev

```

Compile.

```
./build.sh
```

Install.

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

Install runtime dependencies.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libavahi-client3 libevent-pthreads-2.1-7 libevent-core-2.1-7
```

Run it. (It does not require root to run.)

```
/opt/RasPi-NDI-HDMI/RasPi-NDI-HDMI.sh
```

Open an NDI receiver somewhere on the same network. It should detect the Raspberry Pi camera after a few seconds.

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) with the [OBS-NDI plugin](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/) works well.
